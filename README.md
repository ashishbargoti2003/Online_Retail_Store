## Introduction
Our project aims to build a database management system for Croma’s online retail store. Croma is a popular retail store for electronics and other related consumer goods. Our database application will focus solely on its online platform and exclude its offline stores from further discussions. This project's scope encompasses the management of the products, user profiles, procurement of electronic goods from suppliers, and inventory. This project will also aid in the administration of the distribution of the items, which includes the orders placed by the users and by Croma for stock replenishment. Focusing solely on the online platform makes the database system implementation precise and easily manageable. Separating back-end functions into distinct entities, like inventory, distribution, and procurement, ensures a modular design, enhancing scalability.
